    <p>What I have so far is the ability to initialize the board with chips, as well as click and move those
        chips and detect collisions.  Each player can enter a name for themselves and see it displayed on the screen.</p>

    <p>Clicking "Start Game" will cause 12 chips to be placed on the board as they would be at the start of the game.
        If you click a chip, the border of that cell will be thickened to highlight the selected chip. Clicking another
        empty space on the board will move that chip to the desired cell. After you've moved some chips around, click
        the "Reset Game" button to return all chips to their initial positions.</p>

    <p>This is the basis for everything that I'll need in order to get the full game up and running.  The next step
        will be to update the gameState object to match what the player sees on the screen, and also restrict how
        far the player can move a chip.  After that I'll implement detecting jumps as well as multi-jumps. Touching
        up the UI and possibly adding the ability to select from several color schemes is something I'm looking at
        doing once I've gotten the game logic 100% complete.</p>
